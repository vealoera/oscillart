hi everyone! i made oscillart (called lorde oscillart) and you can make sine, square, triangle, and sawtooth (added by me) wave art to different tunes and themes based off lorde albums! i made my project because i always wanted to follow celeste's game jam but never got around to completing it, so once i had the opportunity i did, and also made it lorde themed (i just went to her concert recently and it was TRANSFORMATIONAL)! 

the project was made using HTML, CSS, and Javascript! one thing i really struggled with for this project was the amount of constant variables to keep track of, as well as the logic and math used in the sine waves. from this however, i now better understand how to use functions, alerts, and oscillators!
